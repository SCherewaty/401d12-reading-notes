This isn’t too surprising.  I’ve always been able to take in non-verbal cues about how a person may be feeling.  I’ve also learned from my parents that 
regulating my emotions (i.e., never let anyone see they’re getting to you) gives you an edge in front of groups as I appear more rational than those who do not. 
When I was young and didn’t know myself very well I used to think of these as a kind of “cheat code” for getting what I  wanted out of my parents, 
friends, co-workers…etc.  However, something strange happened in my 20’s.  It was about the time I became an EMT and lived in an ambulance for a few years.  
Being calm and rational in emotional situations actually helped people.  I also found that reading people gave me the ability to see things from their perspective 
and I did in fact feel for them.  There was no “cheating” or manipulation because it was real and softened me to others lives and struggles.

“Evolution favors diversity” is one of my favorite quotes by none other than Charles Darwin.  This applies not only to biology and living organisms but also 
to all things created by those organisms.  Society, business, innovation, engineering…etc., all under the same natural laws that govern living things.  
Some days I don’t want to hear any perspectives other than my own…I yearn for agreement.  Other days, I feel sassy and want to be challenged knowing the 
headache and the petty voice in my head screaming that I’m right will give way to actual growth and a calmer more meaningful life.  
I’m human and I choose to focus on progress in this area…not perfection.
