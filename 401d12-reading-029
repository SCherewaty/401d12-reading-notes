Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples.
Building a threat model allows us make informed decisions about security risks associated with different applications. This is essentially
like examining the process for building a table, listing out the steps and materials and identifying safety hazards you may encounter.

What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?
-What are we working on?
-What can go wrong?
-What are we going to do about it?
-Did we do a good job?

You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team?
I'd always start off with compliance and risk management.  Then I'd be sure to point out that threat modeling helps identify threats
before they become threats.  Security is a "first-cost-least-cost" value proposition, more time and effort spent at the beginning of the product
development cycle the less will be required in operational mode.
