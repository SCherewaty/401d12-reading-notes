What misconfiguration of AWS components allowed the attacker to access sensitive data?
It was a misconfiguration of WAF tied to an EC2 instance and used Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) to call the 
metadata service endpoint using the http://169.254.169.254/iam/security-credentials command.

What are two of the AWS Governance practices that could have prevented such attack?
1. "Don't allow EC2 instances to have IAM roles that allow attaching or replacing role policies in any 
production environment." (Source: https://www.zscaler.com/resources/white-papers/capital-one-data-breach.pdf)
2. "Ensure each application, EC2 instance, or autoscaling group has its own IAM role. Do not share roles 
across unrelated applications."  (Source: https://www.zscaler.com/resources/white-papers/capital-one-data-breach.pdf)
