Explain the levels of abstraction in AWS to someone without a technical background.
Levels of abstraction are the growing number of spaces in between the end user and the hardware (servers).  There is a physical 
component to computing. Back in the day this used to happen in our Atari dual 5 1/2 floppy drives.  Now though, computing happens 
remotely and is managed by services like AWS. There are often multiple orders of separation between the person running the website and 
the service offerin the compute as a service.

What are the control plane and data plane responsible for in container abstraction?
-The control plane is responsible for making the API accessible and interfaces to define, deploy, and lifecycle containers. 
-The data plane is responsible for providing capacity so that containers can run and interface with a network.

Where does AWS Lambda fall in the layers of abstraction and what makes it so special?
AWS Lambda is ALL function. It's a serverless function. In fact it's so much function that its essentially like taking 
a single piece of a fully functioning computer and have it waiting to do a thing on-demand.
