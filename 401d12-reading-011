Is Cybersecurity Automation the Future?
Automated Incident Response Explained

How would a security team benefit from implementing a SOAR solution?
The need for cybersecurity professionals has increased because the complexity of systems and their integrations
has also increased at alarming rates.  Complexity opens vulnerabilities that can make it past human operators
who can't stare at the matrix for hours on end.  SOAR custom code and out-of-the-box sloutions can filter out 
the mundane while still being able to have enough resolution to catch patterns and issues.

Explain how a SOAR solution fits into the Incident Response process.
A SOAR solution would first act as a central hub to tie-in the various threat detection and remediation tools 
at a teams disposal.  Playbooks would be used to prioritize operations and the most machinelike jobs would be
automated.  A SOAR solution would note potential threats and threat patterns.  These would be logged, organized 
prepared for a human powered response.
