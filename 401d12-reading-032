You just started a new job as a Malware Analyst. Explain your job responsibilities to a family member.
I'm essentially a pest control technician for computers.  I spend my day analyzing harmful software bugs and study their behavior to understand how they 
cause damage. Additionally I help develop ways to eliminate them and prevent future infestations. 

What are the six steps of the Malware Analysis process? Whatâ€™s a good mnemonic you can use to remember it?
-Identification  (Inspect)
-Environment Preparation (Every)
-Static Analysis (Suspected)
-Dynamic Analysis (Dangerous)
-Behavioral Analysis (Bug)
-Documentation and Reporting (Rigorously)

You are tasked with analyzing a new malware sample. Which type of malware analysis would you conduct first and why?
