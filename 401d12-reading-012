What is a SOC?

What are three tasks which SOCs often perform?
-Security Event Monitoring and Alerting
-Security Incident Response
-Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

Explain what a SIEM solution is and how the SOC utilizes it in non-technical terms.
A SIEM is like a dispatcher for a SOC's police and firefighters. It gathers information 
from all the security tools on a network and sends it to the SOC analysts, just like a 
dispatcher gathers calls and sends police and firefighters where they're needed. 


How does the typical SOC team structure resemble the structure of an IT Help Desk.
It's done in a tiered configuration meant to eliminate the masses of data then filter down to the things 
that require greater and greater attention and expertise.
