What is the main goal of Threat Hunting and how is it different from traditional threat monitoring?
Threat hunting is actively searching for threats as opposed to sitting back and waiting for a bad actor to tumble into 
a trap.  Ultimately threat hunting is human-driven where much of threat monitoring can (and is) automated.

What are the four types of YARA rules and what does each one of them use to identify and classify malicious software?
"String-based rules: These rules use strings of text, either as literal values or as regular expressions, to identify malware. 
For example, you might use a string-based rule to detect malware that contains a specific string of characters in its code.
File metadata-based rules: These rules use metadata about the files being analyzed to identify malware. 
For example, you might use a file metadata-based rule to detect a particular file type or to identify files that have been created or modified within a specific time period.
Hash-based rules: These rules use cryptographic hashes to identify malware. A cryptographic hash is a unique representation of the contents of a file, and if any part of the file changes, 
the hash will also change. Hash-based rules can be used to detect malware that has been modified or disguised in an attempt to evade detection.
Network-based rules: These rules use network traffic data, such as IP addresses or ports, to identify malware. For example, 
you might use a network-based rule to detect malware that is communicating with a specific IP address or port."

How are YARA rules similar to how Anti-Virus programs detect malicious software?
Both use pattern-matching, signatures and heuristics as well as behavioral analysis to spot malicious software.  YARA is more flexible and customizable 
but not as automatable as traditional AV programs.
