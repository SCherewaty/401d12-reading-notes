What Is Threat Hunting and Why Is It so Important? – Video Blog

How are Threat Hunting and Pentesting different?
Threat hunting is the act of proactively seeking out potential threats and security breaches 
within an organization’s network.  Penetration testing is more like a simulated attack in a controlled
environment.  Threat hunting is like hunting game, like fowl or deer.  Penetration testing is more like
paintball wars between teams.

What is the primary objective of Threat Hunting?
To actively seek out threats, discover previously UNKNOWN threats and enhance detection capabilities by 
updating security controls and response strategies.

Your organization has a fully functioning SOC but not active Threat Hunting. How would you advocate for your security organization to start Threat Hunting activities?
As always I'd first bring up compliance; An organization for threat hunting would strengthen our security posture - including compliance.  
It would also reduce dwell time and damage mitigation time and enhance our detection of advanced threats.
