Security and Risk Management

Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?
For CONFIDENTIALITY the bank can use deterrence; cameras, polarized display screens.  Also each user must use an ATM card and a PIN to access their accounts.
For INTEGRITY the bank keeps records of transactions and has early warning services to spot unusual activity.
For AVAILABILITY the ATM's are out in the open and available for anyone with a back card.

Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.
Separation of duties  
Least privilege
Dual control
