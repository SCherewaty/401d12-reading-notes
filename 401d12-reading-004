How would you convince your manager that applying CIS Benchmarks could fast-track your organizationâ€™s compliance?
For a manager I would fall back on Compliance. "Any organization operating in an industry governed by these types of regulations 
can make significant progress toward compliance by adhering to CIS Benchmarks. In addition, CIS Controls and CIS Hardened Images 
can help support an organization's compliance with GDPR."
