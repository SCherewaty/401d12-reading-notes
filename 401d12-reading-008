What is Data Loss Prevention (DLP)?

How would you convince your organization about the importance of implementing a DLP solution?
If I was speaking to someone in leadership, I would start the conversation from the angle of compliance.  The single biggest roadblock and headache for most businesses is not meeting some authority's standard.  Think IRS audit.
Next, I would lean into the protection of Intellectual Property because those are EXTREMELY valuable assets no one wants disappearing behind a ransom paywall.  Data efficiency or data visibility is the last major point 
I'd chat them up about before they point to their watch and tell me they need get to another meeting.

How would you explain the three main use cases for DLP to friends or family?
1.  What government wants, we do.
2.  We have valuable things, we protect them from thieves.
3.  We prefer a well oiled machine to a rickety contraption.
