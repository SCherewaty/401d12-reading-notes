Getting Started with Zed Attack Proxy

What are the three common stages of the Penetration Testing process and what tasks are performed at each one?
"Explore – The tester attempts to learn about the system being tested. This includes trying to determine what software 
is in use, what endpoints exist, what patches are installed, etc. It also includes searching the site for hidden 
content, known vulnerabilities, and other indications of weakness.
Attack – The tester attempts to exploit the known or suspected vulnerabilities to prove they exist.
Report – The tester reports back the results of their testing, including the vulnerabilities, how 
they exploited them and how difficult the exploits were, and the severity of the exploitation."

Explain a “main-in-the-middle proxy” in non-technical terms.
Using restaurant terms, a main-in-the-middle proxy would be like a security guard checking your 
waiter's ID every time he or she takes your order to the kitchen. 

What are the 2 spiders available for use in ZAP?
Traditional spider (fast but sloppy) and an AJAX spider (slower but more thorough)

What situations are they best suited for?
The traditional spider is good for examining the HTML in responses from the web application.
The AJAX spider invokes browsers and then follows the links that have been generated.
