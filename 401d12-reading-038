Explain how Burp Suite allows us to analyze web application traffic.
One of the tools is a proxy that can intercept web requests and responses and is able to 
read/edit them in real-time before they reach their destinations.

What does the Repeater tool allow us to do with requests?
"The Repeater allows you to import a web request and then make manual modifications to it and see the response 
side by side allowing you to make minor adjustments to attempted exploits and easily see if itâ€™s working."

Why might this be a useful tool for an attacker?
It's useful for fine-tuning exploits and observing the effects of different payloads on the application.
