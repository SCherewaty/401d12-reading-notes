Cross-site scripting

Explain how a cross-site scripting attack works in non-technical terms.
Essentially a hacker takes advantage of a vulnerable website and delivers a payload to an unsuspecting
user of the website.  It's like a spy installing an audio bug in a briefcase in a store after hours.  The 
next day a customer comes into the store and purchases the bugged briefcase and the hacker can now hear the 
customers conversations whereever they go.
