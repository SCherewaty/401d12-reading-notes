The employee backlash over Googleâ€™s censored search engine for China, explained

This relates to ethics in technology because it shows the conflict between profitability and ethical responsibilities. 
The project raises questions about whether tech companies should compromise their values to enter profitable markets, especially 
when it involves supporting authoritarian regimes. The employees' demand for transparency and ethical oversight underscores the need for
companies to consider the broader implications of their actions. To me, this seems like something that will bite them later on down the 
line.  Feeding baby alligators may be fun when they're small and their bite is just a painful nuisance...but they grow into large problems.
Being party to said feeding seems like a liability.  Let's not forget the US supported Osama Bin Laden at one point too.  Ethically speaking, 
corporate execs should refer back to a simple lesson learned in kindergarten; don't fraternize with bullies.


The cybersecurity risk of self-driving cars

This issue relates to ethics in technology because it highlights the balance between innovation and safety. There are potential risks posed 
by cybersecurity vulnerabilities and ensuring that these vehicles are secure from malicious attacks would be crucial to protect public safety, illustrating 
the ethical responsibility of automakers and technology developers. Usually, getting hacked doesn't mean dying in a car crash so this issue delves into some deeper
ethical waters and protection at a higher level is probably necessary.  The ethical obligation extends to regulatory bodies and startups to rigorously test and 
improve the security of these systems, emphasizing the need for ethical guidelines and practices in technological advancements to prevent harm and protect society. 
Honestly, I agree with the forward-looking predictions about safety. Self-driving cars will be MUCH safer for society as a whole when the awkward in-between 
times have come and gone.
