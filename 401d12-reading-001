The Ultimate Guide to SOC 2 Compliance

How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC2 compliance?
I would explain that SOC2 is a more devloped holistic framework that better demonstrates company maturity.  
Demonstrating company maturity is a way to exude stability, which in cooperation with SOC1 (more financial report driven)
greatly increase confidence in the company from employees and customers all the way to investors.

What are the five SOC2 Trust Principles?
-Security
-Confidentiality 
-Availability
-integrity
-Privacy

How would your explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand?
The SOC2 documentation pyramid is a little like a Bibimbap bowl:

-The base or FOUNDATION is comprised high level security policies that explain roles, responsibilities and what the company DOES,
so...the crispy rice in a Bibimbap bowl. Nothing else makes sense without it.

-The next layer is EXECUTION, which explains the processes and procedures of HOW the company lives up to (and follows through with) 
the policies outlined in the first layer.  This is the savory meat or protein in the Bibimbap bowl...different proteins for different industries. 

-Finally the top layer is the PROOF of what was done.  If the 1st and 2nd layers were done correctly then this layer will come as a result
of them.  This is the acid in the Bibimbap bowl that cuts through the savory flavors and gives meaning and appreciation for all the 
previous layers.
