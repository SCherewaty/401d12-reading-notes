Name the six credential-gathering techniques which Mimikatz is able to perform and explain how two of them work.
- Pass-the-Hash 
- Pass-the-Ticket 
- Over-Pass-the-Hash 
- Kerberos Golden Ticket 
- Kerberos Silver Ticket
- DCSync 

Pass-the-Hash works by capturing and using the NTLM hash of a user's password to authenticate without knowing the actual password. 
Pass-the-Ticket can extract Kerberos tickets to access network services. 


What are four ways we can defend against Mimikatz attacks. Explain how two of the mitigations can stop Mimikatz.
Change admin privileges
Change caching policy
Turno off debugging privileges
Increase local security authority
