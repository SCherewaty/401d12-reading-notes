Understanding SQL Injection, Identification and Prevention

What is SQL injection?
It’s a bit like impersonating a CEO’s (or high level leader) email. 
You can send whatever outlandish message to an unwitting employee and probably 
have them do it.  The CEO is presumably honest and so is the unwitting employee. 
It’s the injected instructions that cause the harm.

Can you give an example of how a hacker could use SQL injection to gain unauthorized access?
A hacker could enter a username like admin'-- and any password into a login form. 
The -- comments out the rest of the SQL query, tricking the database into thinking 
the query is only checking for the username admin. This allows the hacker to bypass 
the password check and gain unauthorized access to the admin account.

What are some ways to prevent SQL injection attacks on a web server?
-You can use prepared statements or parameterized queries, which ensure 
user inputs are treated strictly as data. 
-Implement input validation and sanitization to reject suspicious 
or malformed input. 
-Also employ stored procedures to encapsulate and execute SQL queries securely. 
Additionally, restrict database user privileges to the minimum necessary and avoid 
displaying detailed error messages that could aid attackers.
