Explain a Sniffing attack using non-technical terms.
It's like the "telephone" little kids contruct using string and cups.  Except a sniffer would be another kid
tying a third cup and string in between the two other kids to be able to hear what they're saying.

What are the two types of sniffing attacks and what are some pros and cons of each approach?
The two types of sniffing attacks are passive and active sniffing. Passive sniffing involves monitoring and capturing 
data from a network without altering the traffic, making it hard to detect but limited to unencrypted information. 
Active sniffing, involves injecting packets into the network to disrupt traffic and capture data, 
which can expose more information but is easier to detect due to its intrusive nature.

How does encryption protect traffic against sniffing attacks?
Encryption protects traffic against sniffing attacks by encoding the data being transmitted, making it unreadable to 
unauthorized peeps. Even if a sniffer captures the encrypted data, it cannot decipher the content without 
the correct decryption key. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and secure during transmission.
