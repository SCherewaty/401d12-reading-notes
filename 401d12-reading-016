Describe the differences between a VPC and a VPN to someone you know from your previous job.
"A virtual private network (VPN) makes a connection to the public Internet as secure as a connection 
to a private network by creating an encrypted tunnel through which the information travels. You can 
deploy a VPN-as-a-Service (VPNaaS) on your VPC to establish a secure site-to-site communication 
channel between your VPC and your on-premises environment or other location. Using a VPN, you can 
connect subnets in multiple VPCs so that they function as if they were on a single network."
