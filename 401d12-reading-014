The Pros and Cons of Network Intrusion Detection Systems

List 2 differences between firewalls and an IDS?
A firewall controls traffic flow  based on predefined rules but IDS is more passive and monitors traffic for 
malicious activity but doesn't directly block it.  Also, a firewall focuses on enforcing acess rules based on IP addresses, ports or 
protocols IDS focuses on identifying unusual patterns in network traffic that might indicate an attack.

Name 3 major drawbacks of a NIDS?
Lots of false positives
Performance issues
