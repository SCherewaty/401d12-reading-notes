You just got a new job as a Cyber Threat Analyst, how would you explain your role to a family member?
I'd use an analogy to a physical security guard.  Every building has vulnerabilities that make access for criminal 
element spossible and sometimes, easy.  My job is to watch for trespassers and bolstering the defenses og the building.
The only difference is that my job is all digital with the "building" being valuable information.

Explain what makes PowerShell such an effective attack vector.
Windows has the market share of business computers and powershell is Windows. Next, scripts can be obfuscated and run in 
memory, making them difficult for traditional security tools to detect. Also, Powershell has extensive capabilities like system 
functions, Windows API, and especially remote administration.  Very appealing to hacker-types.

What are two things you can do to mitigate attacks that leverage PowerShell?
-Enable logging and monitoring for sure.
-Restrict Powershell scripts through applicatin control policies.
