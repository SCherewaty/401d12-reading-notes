Practice in the Terminal

Many of these commands I've already forgotten so it's good to see them again.  It's amazing how one week can degrade memory.  However, using them on a day to day basis will make them more 
unforgettable. Bash was more useful in 201 but as much as I've been a Windows doubter...I gotta hand it to Powershell.  I've found scripts on Powershell ISE to be easier for me to connect 
to the syntax.  The whole concept of scripting os still new and weird to me.  It's a bit like being told early on that math "isn't your thing", only to realize in college that math IS your
thing and you're actually quite good at it.  Same applies to scripts and coding for me.  I actively avoided it for years and now that I'm looking more closely at it...it still makes only a 
little sense now but it's dawning on me that only more experience is needed, not necessarily higher IQ.
