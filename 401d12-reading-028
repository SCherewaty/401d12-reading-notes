Explain some specifics of why a hacker might want to clear log files to a family member. Do not use the example from the article.
I used an example in class about this.  When I was little I used to snoop through my parents drawers but they always knew I was there becasue of my teeny footprints in the carpet.
I discovered I could snoop with impunity if I swept my foot left and right over the carpet as I backed away from the drawers. It just looked like vacuum cleaner lines in the 
carpet.  The same principle applies to hackers covering their tracks.  A hacker could specifically clear away their activies or they could nuke the whole place (ripping out the whole 
carpet in this analogy) obfuscating everything.
